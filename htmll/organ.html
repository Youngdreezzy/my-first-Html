<h2>We deal in all kind of CCTV Surveillance Camera</h2>
<body>
  We have different types of modern surveillance cameras all over the world,
  here are some examples of cameras:
  <p>
    <strong>Indoor/Dome Camera:</strong>
    The dome camera is one most commonly used for indoor and outdoor security
    and surveillance. The shape of the camera makes it difficult for onlookers
    to tell which way the camera is facing, which is a strong piece of design,
    deterring criminals by creating an air of uncertainty.

    <strong>Outdoor/Bullet Camera:</strong>
    Bullet security cameras are a type video surveillance camera that is
    typically small and shaped like a rifle bullet shell or lipstick case.
    Smaller bullet cameras are typically the diameter of a cigar, but they are
    shorter. Sometimes they are referred to as lipstick cameras. Bullet cameras
    can easily mount to ceilings or walls because most of them use a tri-axis
    type of mount. Infrared bullet cameras tend to be larger in diameter to
    accommodate the additional space that their IR LEDs require.

    <strong>PTZ Camera {Pan Tilt and Zoom}</strong>
    PTZ cameras are robotic devices that are made up of mechanical pieces that
    enable them to pan from left to right, tilt up and down, and zoom in and out
    of the picture. PTZ cameras may also zoom in and out of the image. They are
    often positioned at guard posts where active employees may manage them using
    a remote camera controller.
